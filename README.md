# abn-lookup

A technical test where we perform searches on an ABN dataset

## Technical Test Requirements

- Access data from here - https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/abn-bulk-extract. You should use this dataset in your
  assignment. Do NOT create fake or dummy dataset.
- Clean, merge and normalize the dataset and ingest into a database of your choice.
- Create a clean UI that allows users to search the underlying data in different ways. Some companies that do this
  as https://www.zoominfo.com/, https://www.lusha.com/, https://apollo.io/ . You can look at these for ideas and use
  your own.
- Send us a link to a working prototype that is deployed and hosted in a cloud environment of your choice. Please note,
  both front end and backend need to be deployed, and the data needs to be accessed via an API
- Please include a few slides that explains the architecture and potential improvements that you would like to
  undertake.
